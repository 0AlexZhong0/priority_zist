# Overview

A task list built using Flutter, that helps you to prioritize using the RICE framework by default.

# Get started

- Install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if you haven't already.
- Then setup by following the platform specific guides to run the app on either from the browser, the iOS simulator, the Android simulator or your real devices.

# TODOs

## Frontend MVP

- edit the task from the bottom sheet from tapping on the task.
  - the same interface with the AddTaskView except this time it has the values known ahead of time.
- delete the task on long press.
- think of a data structure that will fit arbitary parameters where a custom formula for sorting the priority.
- declare the data structure in the app and sort the tasks based on the formula.
- change the delete from on long press to swipe to left.
- on long press allows drag and drop of the tasks, the replacement will hint the user the threshold of the new score, then the user custom fine-tune the parameters.

## Backend MVP

- bootstrap the app, models and the implementations.
- more tasks coming soon.
